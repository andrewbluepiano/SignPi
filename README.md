# SignPi
For an old iPod store sign I am making remote controlled. 

Runs a verrrrrrryyyyyyy simple web app on the RasPi (just type the Pi's IP into your browser). Nothing else at this point.

## Setup
Intended to be run on a raspberry pi running raspbian buster with networking already setup. This might be done by running the 'sudo raspi-config' command, going to networking, then setting up your wifi. 

Then do a quick "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbluepiano/SignPi/master/lightPiSetup.sh"

Then a "chmod +x lightPiSetup.sh"

"./lightPiSetup.sh"

Sit back, relax, its gonna be done in a bit!
